# Hello you! 

This website is still under development and not done yet.

In the internet I go by mycf.  
My main interests lie in Haskell, Rust, Scala and Kotlin.

## About this website

I have a love-hate relationship with JavaScript and try to avoid it wherever I can.
However I wanted to make this website and I had a long time interest in Rust,
so I decided to do this website in Rust + WASM + Yew.
Tailwind provides me with nice and easy styling.

I thought about using the hakyll package to generate static websites,
but figured I can just use pandoc directly and convert md to html.
