<h1 id="hello-you">Hello you!</h1>
<p>This website is still under development and not done yet.</p>
<p>In the internet I go by mycf.<br />
My main interests lie in Haskell, Rust, Scala and Kotlin.</p>
<h2 id="about-this-website">About this website</h2>
<p>I have a love-hate relationship with JavaScript and try to avoid it wherever I can. However I wanted to make this website and I had a long time interest in Rust, so I decided to do this website in Rust + WASM + Yew. Tailwind provides me with nice and easy styling.</p>
<p>I thought about using the hakyll package to generate static websites, but figured I can just use pandoc directly and convert md to html.</p>
